Managing job applications and the hiring process through technology isn't a recent innovation.  

`Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)` have a rich history spanning over several decades. Throughout the years they have undergone significant evolution. [In fact, the first ATS system was developed back in 1970s](https://www.onblick.com/blogs/the-evolution-of-applicant-tracking-system-a-historical-perspective). However, it was a very rudimentary software that could only offer only basic data entry and organization of applications. These old versions of ATS relied heavily on manual support for an efficient operation. 

The modern ATS available in the market today employ background automation and are much more capable of performing tasks by themselves. But what exactly is an ATS? What can you expect from it? In this blog, we will discuss everything that you need to know about an *applicant tracking software* to help you develop a very thorough understanding of these **recruiting software**.

## What is an applicant tracking system (ATS)?

An **ATS** is a specialized **talent management tool** that has been designed to help recruiters and organizations to manage their recruitment operations. An **ATS software** allows recruiters to collect talent information, organize their database, and to filter and manage the candidates. [According to recent data, more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies are currently using an applicant tracking system to develop a more efficient hiring culture.](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/fortune-500-use-applicant-tracking-systems/)
 
> While there are **HRIS software** which allow recruiters to store and sort talent information, **ATS systems** have gained popularity because of the multitude of features that they offer. Most **applicant tracking systems** in the market enable an efficient talent collection, management and organization. Some of the better **ATS systems** in the market also offer insights and analytics to enable the recruiters to make better decisions and come up with better recruitment strategies. **Best ATS systems** today empower talent acquisition teams to track all communications with prospective hires in a single location and work more efficiently to effectively engage, interview, and analyze leads.

In short, **applicant tracking systems (ATS)** are **talent management tools** that have been designed to help recruiters find the top of the talents that closely match the job profile.

## How do applicant tracking systems work?

**Applicant tracking systems (ATS)** are designed to work alongside the recruiter every step of the way.

An ATS software proves invaluable in every aspect of operations, whether it be drafting a job description or extending a job offer. Certain **ATS systems** in the market go as far as enabling users to automate job requisitions and offer letters, thereby, substantially alleviating the workload of their users.

In order to understand the working of a typical **ATS** better, let’s explore the functionality using an example. [Somhako](https://www.somhako.com/en/about) is one of the **best ATS** in the market, that is providing a cost-effective talent management solution to recruiters wordwide. 

Let’s try to trace the process of recruitment through an ATS, using Somhako ATS as an illustrative example. Here is an outline of the stages within this process:

1. The recruiter adds a job requirement and a job description into this **recruiting software**. Somhako ATS allows users to generate an instant job requisition with the help of an AI. Other **ATS** in the market also have similar features. Some of them don’t offer an AI generated description but offer templates instead. 

2. Once the requirements have been generated and added into the system, the job gets posted across multiple locations. The talent pool can now view, and apply, to this job. Their applications get collected within the database of the **ATS software**. 

3. The **applicant tracking software** now proceeds to analyze these applications, cross-referencing the job profile details with the information provided in applicants' resumes. Somhako ATS, for instance, prioritizes and ranks these applicant profiles for the benefit of recruiters while simultaneously suggesting candidates the positions that align closely with their resumes. This process significantly enhances the quality of talent search outcomes. Similarly, numerous other **ATS systems** provide resume parsing features, enabling the ranking and sorting of applicant resumes based on their relevance to the job. 

4. The recruiters then have to review these shortlisted applications and select the candidates that they think are suitable. In case of Somhako ATS, an automated selection email is promptly dispatched to both the candidate and the client, therefore expediting the interview scheduling. Similar functionality can also be found in other **recruiting software** available in the market. 

5. ATS now ensures that the recruiter remains informed about the progress of the selected candidates throughout the hiring process. Recruiters also often have the option to add personal notes and feedback within the system, which they can revisit at a later stage.

6. When a candidate clears the interview, the software will also often send an offer letter to the candidates. Somhako ATS, for instance, uses an AI to enable the recruiter to generate a customised offer letter every time. Other ATS software usually offer some similar features or templates. 

7. When the candidate accepts the offer letter, they are "hired" into the HR system. This information is stored for future reference. 

8. Some of the **best ATS** solutions in the market, such as Somhako ATS, meticulously track and analyze each stage of the process, generating insights that can be used by recruiters to consistently enhance their decision-making capabilities.

The automation and the organization that an ATS brings to the process of recruitment cannot be underestimated. By enabling swift action and unbroken communication, an **applicant tracking software** allows the recruiter and the organization to save a lot of time which is essentially the most precious asset of the corporate world.

## How to find the best applicant tracking system (ATS) for your needs?    

There are many **ATS systems** in the market but to find the **best ATS** for your needs, you would need to have a good understanding of your own hiring requirements as well as the **talent management tools** an ATS offers. We have identified three major pointers that could help you in identifying an ideal **recruiting software** for yourself:

### Identify your requirements

    - Before you begin your hunt for an ideal ATS, you should have a good understanding of your recruitment needs. Every organisation has a slightly different talent acquisition culture. Understanding yours could give you a good idea of what **recruiting software** will fit well with your workflow and what will not. 

    - It would also be a good idea to identify what kind of talent pool is the ATS software targeting.

    - If you are looking to buy an **applicant tracking system**, we recommend signing up for trials and demos before buying the software so that you can experience it first hand and see if it really is worth the cost. 


### Evaluate the ATS
